# NLP 👨‍💻

The purpose of this repository is to practice NLP-related machine learning models and methodologies with Tensorflow. Currently, I am following a [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/share/104sRw3@D4fIWuFk4kfelFPyPMINZmgld0UP4HVnutCd3x8Prd0WQgOhAyBn1yjjPbdZiHwNcw==/). In addition, I will add self-learning materials to this repository.

*  Model 0: Naive Bayes (baseline)
*  Model 1: Feed-forward neural network (dense model)
*  Model 2: LSTM model
*  Model 3: GRU model
*  Model 4: Bidirectional-LSTM model
*  Model 5: 1D Convolutional Neural Network
*  Model 6: TensorFlow Hub Pretrained Feature Extractor
