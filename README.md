# NLP üë®‚Äçüíª

The purpose of this repository is to practice NLP-related machine learning models and methodologies with Tensorflow. Currently, I am following a [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/share/104sRw3@D4fIWuFk4kfelFPyPMINZmgld0UP4HVnutCd3x8Prd0WQgOhAyBn1yjjPbdZiHwNcw==/). In addition, I will add self-learning materials to this repository.
